# professional-portfolio
The Goals of this project were:
- create a sample porfolio for a potential employee
- portfolio includes:
    - image or avatar of developer
    - name of developer
    - UI scrolls to corresponding section when clicked in the navigation bar
    - developer's projects should have images, the first image should be larger than the rest
    - when the image is clicked, it opens project
    - when page is resized, the layout is still responsive to the view change.

Throughout this project we will use HTML and Advanced CSS to achieve the final goal of a responsive portfolio.
